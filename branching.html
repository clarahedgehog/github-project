                <h3 class="article-title">Why is branching important?</h3>
                <p class="article-text">Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do
                    work without messing with that main line. In many VCS tools, this is a somewhat expensive process,
                    often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory, which can take a long time
                    for large projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Why is it so special? The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making
                    branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally
                    just as fast. Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even
                    multiple times in a day. Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique
                    tool and can entirely change the way that you develop.

                    <b>Creating a New Branch:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    What happens when you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move
                    around. Let’s say you want to create a new branch called testing. You do this with the git branch
                    command:
                    <br><br>
                    <i>$ git branch testing</i>
                    <br><br>
                    This creates a new pointer to the same commit you’re currently on.

                    <br><br>
                    You can have head branches automatically deleted after pull requests are merged in your repository.
                    If the branch you want to delete is associated with an open pull request, you must merge or close
                    the pull request before deleting the branch.
                    If you delete a head branch after its pull request has been merged, GitHub checks for any open pull
                    requests in the same repository that specify the deleted branch as their base branch. GitHub
                    automatically updates any such pull requests, changing their base branch to the merged pull
                    request's base branch.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>-d
                        --delete</i>
                    <br><br>
                    Delete a branch. The branch must be fully merged in its upstream branch, or in HEAD if no upstream
                    was set with --track or --set-upstream-to.
